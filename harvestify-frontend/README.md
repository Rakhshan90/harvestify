# HARVESTIFY: Full-stack Online auction system
I built Harvestify, a MERN stack auction platform with custom bidding algorithms, designed to create a transparent and efficient experience for farmers and buyers in the agricultural sector.

## Back-end repository:
The REST APIs are all derived from my backend application. Here is the link to the backend source code.
```bash

```

## The Problem:
Today's agricultural commerce relies heavily on offline auctions, often involving a middleman who connects farmers and buyers. This system adds unnecessary cost and creates an information gap between producers and consumers.

## Harvestify's Solution:
Harvestify is an online auction platform built for efficiency and transparency. Farmers and buyers connect directly, eliminating the need for middlemen and reducing costs.
